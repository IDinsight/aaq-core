# Using the admin app

You can use the admin app to create new content, edit or delete an existing one.
If you have the [application running](../deployment/quick-setup.md), you can access the admin app at:

    https://[DOMAIN]/

or if you are using the [dev](../develop/setup.md) setup:

    http://localhost:3000/

You will need to login to continue.
