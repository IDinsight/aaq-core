# Hello Material UI!

## Cleaner, familiar, easier

Design best practices are 'best practices' for having a proven track record of creating engaging, intuitive, and effective user experiences. Google has encapsulated this in the creation of MaterialUIâ€”a design language well-infused with the principles of good design. Embracing these principles, we're thrilled to announce a significant shift in our project's Admin App: the transition to using MaterialUI components.

This shift is not merely about adopting a new set of tools; it's a step towards cleaner, more maintainable code, and a commitment to providing familiar and enhanced user experiences.

We're already starting to see some benefits of moving to Material UI:

- Cleaner Codebase:
  MaterialUI components are modular and customizable, and has allowed us to achieve a polished look with less custom CSS.

- Easier to Build and Maintain:
  MaterialUI's extensive component library has significantly reduced our development time. Components like buttons, nav bars, and switches come with a variety of options that are easily customizable.

- Familiarity and Consistency:
  MaterialUI is a design language familiar to millions of users worldwide, thanks to Google's widespread implementation across its products. This is helping us lower the learning curve for new users and is ensuring consistency across devices.
