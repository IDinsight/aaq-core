# Improved docs!

First, we have added this section that you are currently reading. Each week we'll post
what we've rolled out - new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements.

The rest of the docs have now also been restructured to make it easy to parse.

## Now with cards!

A lot of the index pages now show cards like the one shown below. These should
make it easy to grasp the content in section in a glance.

## Process Flow Diagrams

[Semantic search](../../components/qa-service/semantic-search.md#process-flow) and
[LLM Response](../../components/qa-service/llm-response.md#process-flow)
pages both now show process flow diagrams. It should make it a lot easier to understand
what is happening under the hood when you call either of these endopints.
