# Did someone say Dashboard?

Getting insights from your app has been made easy with the introduction of a questions dashboard page.

<!-- more -->

## Question dashboard

On the Admin App, you can now get statistics from your question answering service with the new dashboard displaying information such as:

- The number of questions answered during the current month
- The number of questions with positive feedback
- The number of questions asked during the past 6 months.

The dashboard is in its first version and in the future we are planning on adding more informations such as [Urgency Detection](../../components/urgency-detection/index.md) related statistics, and content related statistics.

## Doc references

- [QA Service](../../components/qa-service/index.md)
