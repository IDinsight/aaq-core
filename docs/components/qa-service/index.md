# Question-Answering Service

There are two major endpoints that your application can integrate with:


<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Semantic Search__

    ---

    Allows searching through the content database. Use similarity between
    embeddings of questions and the content to return the best matches

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: More info](./semantic-search.md)

-   :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __LLM Response__

    ---

    Constructs an answer to the user's questions using an LLM and the most similar
    content in the database.

</div>

## Capturing Feedback

The service also provides two endpoint to capture feedback from users. One to capture
feedback for the response returned and the other for the content items retrieved.

For both of these, you can provide feedback as sentiment ("positive", "negative"),
as text, or as both.


<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Response Feedback__

    ---

    Allows users to provide feedback on the response generated by the either Semantic Search or LLM Response.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: More info](./response-feedback.md)

-   :material-api:{ .lg .middle } __Content Feedback__

    ---

    Allows users to provide feedback on the content items returned by the Semantic Search.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: More info](./content-feedback.md)
