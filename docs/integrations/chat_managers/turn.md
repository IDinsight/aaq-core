# Turn.io

Below is an example of how to connect a Turn.io Journey to AAQ endpoints.

1. Create a new Journey (select Code when asked)
2. Copy paste the contents of the `journey_code.txt` file given under `chat_managers/turn.io/` in this repo into the Journey's code area.
3. Replace <INSERT_AAQ_URL> and <INSERT_AAQ_TOKEN> values to reflect the AAQ endpoint URL that you have running.
4. Test the bot in the emulator
