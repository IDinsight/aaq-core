Some cramps and/or discomfort in the tummy are usual during pregnancy. Cramping happens when the womb (uterus) grows🤰🏽. This stretches ligaments and muscles supporting the womb. It can be more noticeable when you sneeze, cough, or change positions.

During the second trimester, cramping is usually because of round ligament pain. This feels like a sharp, jabbing pain 💢 on one or both sides of your belly.

During the third trimester, you can experience Braxton hicks contractions. These are practice contractions that prepare your body for your upcoming birth. Braxton hicks contractions are usually irregular, both in how strong and how long they are.

*What to do*
Never ignore strong or constant abdominal pain. The difference between a cramp and pain could be confusing, so don't hesitate to go to the clinic if you are worried.

Go to the clinic if the pain gets worse or continues for several minutes – or if you have any of the following symptoms:
- spotting or bleeding 🩸
- unusual vaginal discharge 💧
- chills or fever 🤒
- faintness 💫
- discomfort while urinating 😓
- nausea and vomiting 🤢","['stomach', 'pain', 'contractions']","[0.1, 0.1, 0.1]",1,,

Pain or aching 💢 in the back is common during pregnancy. Throughout your pregnancy the hormone relaxin is released. This hormone relaxes the tissue that holds your bones in place in the pelvic area. This allows your baby to pass through you birth canal easier during delivery. These changes together with the added weight of your womb can cause discomfort 😓 during the third trimester.

*What to do*
- Place a hot water bottle 🌡️ or ice pack 🧊 on the painful area.
- When you sit, use a chair with good back support 🪑, and sit with both feet on the floor.
- Get regular exercise🚶🏽‍♀️and stretch afterwards.
- Wear low-heeled 👢(but not flat ) shoes with good arch support.
- To sleep better 😴, lie on your side and place a pillow between your legs, with the top leg on the pillow.

If the pain doesn't go away or you have other symptoms, visit the clinic.

During the first trimester, your body experiences a surge of hormones and an increase in blood volume. These two changes can cause more frequent headaches during pregnancy🤰🏽. But after 20 weeks of pregnancy, a bad headache could mean pre-eclampsia. This is a serious pregnancy condition.

Normal headaches 🤕 can be from lack of sleep, sinus infection, allergies, eye strain, stress, depression, hunger or dehydration, flickering or bright lights, loud noises, tobacco smoke, and strong smells.

For most women, the first sign of labour is contractions. Contractions are cramps of the womb that start in your lower belly and feel like strong period pains. 💢 You will feel your womb becoming hard and painful. Some women will also have lower back pain during contractions.

*Early labour*
At the start of labour, your contractions will be short and spaced apart. They are usually mild and you can go about your day as normal. As time passes, you will start to feel the contractions growing longer, closer together and more painful. This is when you should start to time your contractions.

Make a note of how long each contraction is from start to finish. Also note how much time passes between the start of one contraction and the start of the next contraction. ⏱️

*Active Labour*
When contractions start to become more regular, longer and painful, then you are in active labour. If, during these contractions, you cannot focus on anything else 😖 – then it's time to go to the hospital.

*What to do*
During early labour you can go about your day as usual. Continue to eat and drink. To help you cope with the pain, have a bath or shower. 🛀🏽 Breathing exercises and movement like walking around also help with the pain.🚶🏽‍♀️ You only need to go to the clinic/hospital when you are in active labour.

When your waters break, it will feel like a *gush or a trickle* that you cannot control. The water should be clear without any colour. There may be some bloody 🩸 discharge. If the water is green, brown or bloody, your baby may be in distress.

*What to do*

The four stages of labour will each feel very different. Having your first baby usually takes longer than if you gave birth before, but labour is unlikely to last more than 18 hours.

*Early labour*
This is the first part of you labour and usually the longest. The entrance to your womb (the cervix) starts to shorten, soften and open up. Contractions are mild, short and spaced apart and often feel like period pains or lower back pain. 💢 You can still focus on other things while having contractions. Continue to eat 🥙 and drink 🚰.

*Active labour*
When your cervix is about 4 cm open, you are considered to be in the active stage of labour. This stage normally lasts about 6 hours. During active labour, your contractions become stronger, longer and more frequent. You now need to focus on the contractions. As the pain intensifies, some women will start to breathe 🌬️ or moan through the contractions.

*Pushing stage*
Once your cervix is fully dilated (10cm), you will be encouraged to push. For a first-time mom, pushing can last up to 2 hours. If you had a baby before, the pushing is normally a lot quicker.

During the pushing stage, your body starts to actively push your baby down and out. You will feel like you need to poo (bear down). As baby's head comes out of the vagina, you may experience a burning sensation. This is called the ring of fire. 🔥 You are now just a few contractions away from delivering your baby.

*Placenta stage*
The placenta is an organ that develops in your uterus during pregnancy. It brings oxygen and food to your baby.
After your baby is born, you will need to deliver the placenta. This usually happens within 1 hour after birth. During delivery of the placenta, you will feel period pains 💢 and you will be asked to push.","['labour', 'stages', 'pains', 'water', 'discharge', 'contraction']","[0.1, 0.1, 0.1]",1,,

MomConnect has no way of knowing if your baby is a boy or girl. You get messages from MomConnect using 'he' or 'she' when describing your baby. This is so that every mom can get 1 out of 2 messages about her baby using the correct gender.

*What to do*

During pregnancy it's important that you eat a healthy diet. Your diet should be a combination of foods that provide protein, vitamins and minerals, healthy types of fat, fibre and fluids. Although it's important to eat a bit more than you normally would, you don't have to 'eat for two'.

*What to do*
- Drink at least 8 glasses of water per day. 🚰
- Eat foods containing iron – like maize meal, bread, nuts, fully cooked eggs, meat, fish, mopane worms, chicken, and green vegetables. 🥦
- Vitamin C improves the absorption of iron into your body. Oranges, tomatoes and sweet potatoes are full of vitamin C. 🍊
- Eat dairy products daily, such as milk, yogurt and hard cheese. These are high in calcium and protein. 🥛
- Eating lentils, peas, beans, and peanuts will assist with the intake of fibre, protein, iron, folate, and calcium. 🥜
- Wholegrains like brown bread, rice and oats are good options to add fibre to your diet. 🍞","['safe', 'food', 'vegetable', 'fruit']","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.3]",1,,

A bladder infection (or cystitis), is a common type of urinary tract infection (UTI). Cloudy, bloody or smelly urine 💦 – along with pain or a burning sensation – are signs that you may have a bladder infection.

You will likely want to urinate (pee) more often. This is good, as it helps to move any potential infection out of the bladder. You may also experience pain 💢 or a burning sensation during sex.

In early pregnancy, the need to pee a lot is normal. This is because of hormonal changes that speed up the blood flow to your kidneys, filling your bladder faster and more often. Later in pregnancy, the need to pee may return as your growing baby 🤰🏽 puts pressure on your bladder. This is nothing to worry about.

*What to do*
- If you have signs of a bladder infection, visit the clinic for advice on medicine. Do not take any medication unless it is prescribed.
- Drink lots of clean water and pee often. 💦

The best position for your baby at birth is head-down. This is called the cephalic position. Baby usually turns into this position between weeks 28 to 32 of your pregnancy🤰🏽. Some babies only turn head-down moments before labour begins. There is no need to be worried if your baby hasn't turned before 36 weeks.

During your pregnancy clinic visits, a nurse/midwife 👩🏽‍⚕️ will examine your belly with her hands to feel baby's position. If she suspects baby might be breech, she’ll do an ultrasound for confirmation.

*Breech position* is when the baby's bum or feet are down. Less than 5% of babies are born this way. If your baby doesn’t turn by week 37, your nurse/midwife may try to do an external cephalic version (ECV). During an ECV, she will place her hands 👐🏽 on your stomach and push the baby into the head-down position using firm but gentle pressure.

If your baby stays in breech position, you are likely to give birth by cesarean section. Please talk to your nurse/midwife about your options.

*What to do*
- Make sure you go to all your pregnancy visits🤰🏽 to have baby's position checked.
- If most of your baby's kicks are low in your belly and/or you feel a hard bump below your ribs, please let your nurse/midwife 👩🏽‍⚕️ know.

Half of pregnant women get constipation when pregnant.🤰🏽 During early pregnancy, constipation is a common problem caused by progesterone, the pregnancy hormone. This slows down the digestive tract muscles and processes food more slowly through the intestines.

Later in pregnancy, the growing baby in your uterus puts pressure on your rectum (anus). Straining during bowel movements or passing hard stools can cause swollen, uncomfortable veins in the anus (hemorrhoids).

*What to do*
- Drink 8 to 10 glasses of water per day🚰,
- Eat food high in fibre 🍠 (fruit, vegetables, beans, lentils, wholemeal breads, cereals, brown rice),
- Exercise regularly – simply walking🚶🏽‍♀️or dancing can ease constipation,

Loss of appetite could be due to nausea 🤢 and vomiting caused by pregnancy hormones. Even mild nausea and vomiting can put you off food.

Pregnancy's hormonal changes may increase your appetite and make you more hungry. 😋 This could be in the second trimester when morning sickness fades. The main reason you're hungrier is because your body needs more nutrition to support your growing baby.🤰🏽

Avoid binge eating (eating too much at one sitting). It increases risks like miscarriage and birth defects.

The size of your belly may not show the real size of your baby. Women with strong tummy muscles will have a belly that looks smaller. With a second or third baby, your tummy muscles are already stretched and your pregnancy belly may look bigger.🤰🏽

Pregnancy belly size also depends on:

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a coronavirus discovered in 2019. Coronaviruses are large groups of viruses common throughout the world.

Most people with COVID-19 will have mild to moderate respiratory illness. They'll recover without special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, HIV, TB, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to get seriously ill.

COVID-19 spreads through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. That's why it's important to wash your hands and cough into your flexed elbow or a tissue.

If this happens, there is no reason to be concerned. You should be reassured that it is very unlikely that there will be any harmful effects from receiving the COVID-19 vaccine for you or your baby.

This is especially true if you are a healthcare or essential worker or have a high-risk medical condition. However, in the end getting the vaccine is your choice. Please discuss your options with your healthcare provider.

We recommend that you use paracetamol tablets for this. These side effects are usually mild and only last a few days.

Severe complications of the vaccine (e.g. abnormal blood clotting) have been reported but are extremely rare. You are far more likely to get COVID-19 infection and die from it than to get any severe complication of the vaccine.

Exercising during pregnancy is good for you and your baby. It improves your mood and fitness. It can help speed up your recovery after birth. Your baby may also get a brain health boost 🧠 and a heart that is more fit. Exercises like walking, dancing, swimming and yoga/stretching classes 🧘🏽‍♀️ are safe options during your pregnancy.

Thirty minutes of exercise for 5 days out of 7 is good for your heart and general health.

*What to do*
There are exercises you can do at home:
- Take three brisk 10-minute walks during the day 🚶🏽‍♀️,
- Walk up and down a flight of stairs. Support yourself using the rail,
- Clean the house 🧹 and yard (house work does counts as exercise!)
- Play your favourite music and dance 💃🏽.

You may worry if sex is safe during pregnancy. But if you have a normal pregnancy, it's safe to have sex. Your baby is protected by strong uterus muscles and the thick mucus plug that seals the cervix.

Some women experience an increased sex drive during pregnancy. Your vagina and breast may be more sensitive and your orgasms may be more intense. But a decrease in your sex drive is just as normal in pregnancy, it’s totally okay to not be in the mood. 🤷🏽‍♀️

*When to avoid sex*

- You have vaginal bleeding 🩸,
- You are at risk for pre-term birth,
- You have been told that you have placenta previa,
- You are worried about sexually transmitted infections including HIV and do not have a condom,
- The nurse/midwife advised you against having sex. 🙅🏽‍♀️

*During sex*

Pregnancy brings many body changes – like changes to the shape, size and appearance of your breasts.

*First trimester (months 1 to 3)*
- Your breasts grow larger,
- They may become sore or tender,
- You may notice veins that are more blue and visible,
- Your areola (the ring around the nipple) becomes darker or more sensitive.

As pregnancy progresses, your breasts keep changing. A chemical in your body called prolactin increases your breast size and starts milk production.

*Second trimester (months 4 to 6)*
- Your milk ducts develop and you may need a larger bra size (or two) to be comfortable,
- Colostrum is the first type of breast milk your body makes. You may see this leaking into your bra. It is thicker and stickier than breast milk and very healthy for your baby.

*Third trimester (months 7 to 9)*
- Your breasts become heavier
- Your areola and nipples may grow darker
- Itchiness or dryness are normal because your skin has to stretch
- If you develop stretch marks, protect your skin with a moisturising cream.

According to the SA Maternal guidelines, every pregnant woman should have at least 1 routine scan at around 18-20 weeks. This scan will confirm your due date, how many babies you are carrying and the location of the placenta.

However, sometimes the nurse/midwife feels it's necessary to refer you for extra ultrasound scans. These scans would be due to medical reasons. If you have a high risk pregnancy, you will need more regular hospital visits 🏥 and may have more ultrasound scans during your pregnancy.

*What to do*
- Focus on being pregnant – talk to your baby 🗣️ and imagine what he is doing and feeling,
- Listen to your body – take breaks and short sleeps 😴 when tired or anxious,
- Eat healthy and drink lots of water🚰,
- Get enough sleep: to sleep more comfortably, lie on your side with pillows behind and in front of you 🛌🏽 – ask family members to look after other children you have,

If you have suffered a miscarriage, we're very sorry for your loss. 😢

Miscarriage is when you lose your baby within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Between one and two out of ten pregnancies ends in a miscarriage. It's important you know that a miscarriage usually happens for reasons that you have no control over.

Women are more likely to miscarry if they:
- are over 40,
- have had 2 or more miscarriages already,
- have chronic disease (like high blood pressure, diabetes or lupus) or infections (like HIV, mumps, rubella, measles, gonorrhea),
- smoke, drink and use drugs,
- are obese,
- fall pregnant again shortly after giving birth.

*Signs of miscarriage*
- Bleeding or spotting 🩸(finding blood spots on underpants or toilet paper),
- Bleeding followed by lower back pain or tummy pain that feels like cramps 💢,
- Baby's heartbeat 💓 cannot be found during an ANC visit.

*Reasons to go to the clinic* 🏥
Have someone go with you to the clinic immediately if you notice bleeding or cramping during pregnancy. Or if you think you already miscarried. Use a sanitary pad to catch any blood or fetal tissue (it will look greyish and may have blood clots). Don't use a tampon.

At the clinic, the nurse/midwife will confirm the miscarriage and check that all fetal tissue has come out.

*Coping after miscarriage*
You may feel grief, anger or vulnerability. Wait before trying for another pregnancy. Get help if you experience deep and ongoing sadness. Take time off work if you need it. Keep communicating with your partner in an open and honest way. Look after yourself. 🤗","['miscarriage', 'cope', 'age']","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]",1,,

As the time for labour gets closer, please start to save money 💵 for things like transport and airtime for your phone. Think about how you will get to the hospital.🏥 If you have children, decide who will stay home with them. It's also a good idea to decide who will go to the hospital with you. Choose someone reliable and let them know that you would like them to be your birth partner.

It's normal to be anxious for your upcoming birth, especially if it is your first. Try to read or watch videos about birth 📺 and discuss your fears when you are at the clinic for your pregnancy visits. The nurse/midwife at the clinic will discuss your birth plan with you.

*What to do*
By week 37 of pregnancy, please get a small bag ready for when you need to go to the hospital. Your bag should have:
- Your maternity record 📋 from the clinic
- A towel, facecloth and toiletries like soap 🧼, sanitary (or maternal) pads, toothbrush, toothpaste.
- Baby wipes, nappies, bum cream 🧴, cotton wool and surgical spirits.

Good sleep is important for your health. 😴 You need 7 to 8 hours each night. Sleep keeps your mood steady, helps you to think clearly and make good decisions and prevents sickness.

Sleep problems won't harm you or baby, but it can make life feel more difficult. In the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, you may feel more tired than usual. As your pregnancy progresses, it may be more difficult to sleep comfortably with a larger belly. 🤰🏽

*What to do*
- Go to bed early ⏰,
- Avoid sleeping on your back after 20 weeks of pregnancy as it may increase the risk of stillbirth. Sleep on your side 🛌🏽 (ideally the left side) – it's more comfortable and improves blood flow, increasing the nutrients that reach your baby,
- If you are heavily pregnant, place a pillow between your bent legs and knees for a more comfortable position – or you could also place a pillow below your belly and behind your back,

You might experience anxious or sad feelings called 'baby blues' in the first week after giving birth. 😔 If this feeling lasts for more than 2 weeks, go to the clinic.

The first bowel movement (poo) after birth is usually after 3 days. Eat high fibre foods 🍠 and drink lots of water 🚰 to keep your poo soft.

*Natural birth*
Most women are discharged from hospital 6 hours after birth. Your body needs time to recover. Your vagina will likely be sore, especially if you have stitches. You are still bleeding 🩸 and may experience afterbirth contractions 💢.

Take your time and rest when you can. If you have stitches, make sure to keep them clean. Rinse your vagina after every toilet visit and pat dry afterwards. The stitches should fall out or dissolve by themselves in 5 to 7 days. If your vagina is swollen, use an ice pack 🧊 wrapped in a towel for pain relief.

Usually labour will start on its own. Do not induce labour on your own with home remedies or medication that was not prescribed. Seek advice from the clinic.

But sometimes, an induction of labour is necessary due to health concerns for you and/or your baby. Induction of labour is when you receive medication 💊 from your doctor or nurse to start labour contractions.

Most women can give birth naturally, but sometimes during pregnancy or labour, a Caesarean section becomes the safest option for the birth of your baby. 🤰🏽

A C-section is an abdominal surgical operation where your baby is born through a cut that your health care provider makes in your belly and uterus. During this operation, your baby is removed through your tummy. You will usually receive spinal anaesthetic 💉 which numbs the lower part of your body. This means you will be awake throughout the operation – but you won't feel any pain.

Recovery after giving birth through a C-section takes longer and is often more painful 💢 . You will receive pain medication. 💊 Please take them as prescribed.

After a C-section you should eat a healthy mix of foods, including iron-rich foods (like spinach 🥬). This will help your body to heal and to replace any blood lost during the operation. Avoid any foods that make you gassy.  Drink lots of water 🚰 and eat foods full of fiber (like fruits and vegetables) to help avoid constipation.

The nurses will encourage you to get out of bed about 6 hours after the C-section. This may seem soon, but it will actually help speed up your healing.

If you've already given birth through a C-section, you may be able to have your next baby through a vaginal birth. This is called 'Vaginal birth after Caesarean'. ","['c', 'section', 'recovery']","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]",1,,

Some babies are born with black marks called Mongolian spots on their body. The spots are flat and grey-blue in colour and look almost like a bruise. Mongolian spots are common and harmless.

Changing your baby's nappy might seem complicated at first 🤔 – but with practice it will soon be simple and easy. Babies should never be left unattended, so make sure that when you change baby, your supplies are within reach. 🖐🏽

*What you will need*
- A nappy,
- A clean washcloth or wet wipes,
- Nappy cream or vaseline,
- A changing mat to lay your baby on.

*Four steps to changing a nappy*

1. Use a wet washcloth or wipe to gently clean baby from the front to the back. (Never wipe from back to front – especially with girls, as this can spread bacteria.) Lift your baby's legs by the ankles to get underneath. Don't forget the creases in baby's thighs and buttocks.

2. After cleaning, pat baby dry with a clean washcloth and apply nappy cream. 🧴

3. Put on the nappy by opening it up, gently lifting baby's legs and feet, then sliding it under baby's bum/back. Next, bring the front part of the nappy up between your baby's legs and up onto the belly. Use the adhesive strips to fasten it snugly. Be careful not to stick the tape onto baby's skin.

4. With a boy, point the penis downwards before closing the nappy. This will help prevent leaks. If your baby's umbilical cord hasn't yet fallen off, fold the nappy waistline down. This will keep the cord dry and prevent irritation. Always wash your hands 🧼 after changing a nappy.

*Nappy rash*
It's common for babies to get nappy rash. But if your baby has a fever with the rash – or if the rash seems painful, is bright red, or baby also has blisters – then please go to the clinic 🏥.

*Preventing nappy rash*
Make sure you change your baby's nappy as soon as possible after it has become wet 💦 or soiled 💩. Clean your baby's bum well after each bowel movement and allow the area to dry, being careful not to rub the skin for too long or too hard. Put a thin layer of nappy cream 🧴 or vaseline on your baby's bum. When putting on a fresh nappy, secure it comfortably – not too tight or too loose, so that some air can circulate.

*Treating a nappy rash*
- Help baby's skin to air out by letting him/her spend some time each day without wearing a nappy.
- After a poo, clean baby's bum well and pat it dry before putting on a clean nappy.
- Spread a thick layer of nappy cream or vaseline to stop urine getting onto the irritated skin.

When a newborn baby turns yellow 🟡 after birth, it's called newborn jaundice. This often appears on the 3rd day of baby's life. It is caused by bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced during normal breakdown of red blood cells.

In older babies the liver breaks down bilirubin. But your newborn's liver is still maturing and this can mean higher levels of bilirubin are present in your baby's blood 🩸.

In most cases, newborn jaundice is harmless and will go away by itself within 2 weeks. But sometimes your baby may need help to process the bilirubin.

When a baby refuses breast milk 🤱🏽 or formula 🍼, it's called a nursing strike. This can happen for a number of reasons. Your baby could be:
- teething,
- fighting an earache or a cold,
- reacting to something you ate.

Sometimes, nursing strikes happen for no clear reason. The good news is that they are often temporary.

*What to do*
Continue to offer the breast, but don't force your baby. Try to express your milk to keep up your milk production. Give this stored milk to the baby using a cup or a bottle. If your baby still refuses to drink after a couple of days, take baby to the clinic 🏥.

*Refusing the bottle*
Breastfed babies sometimes refuse to drink from a bottle. This is probably because they prefer the breast over the bottle. Your baby may also expect to be breastfed when you are nearby. In this case, it may help to have someone else offer the bottle to your baby. If baby 👶🏽 refuses to drink from a bottle, even when you are away, try to feed with a cup.

*Refusing formula*
Teething, earache or having a cold 🤧 are common reasons why your formula-fed baby refuses the bottle. If you have just started baby on solids, he might not be hungry.

Babies are born with soft spots on their heads called fontanels. 👶🏽 These are openings in the baby’s skull where the skull bones have not yet grown and joined together. Be careful with these soft spots.

Babies have fontanels on the top, back, and sides of their head. There are two reasons why these fontanels are open:

*1️⃣ At birth*
At birth, fontanels allow the bones of the skull to move so that the baby’s head can change shape during delivery. The birth canal is narrow, and the movement of the bones 🦴 helps the baby’s head to pass through.

*2️⃣ Through growth*
A newborn's head is small, but it grows quickly over the first two years of life. The open fontanel leaves space for the growth of your baby's brain and head. It takes about two years 🗓️ for the fontanels to close.

Around day 5, your baby should have between 2 to 5 yellow soft poos each day. Newborn babies 👶🏽 often poo after every feed (about 6 times in a day).

Newborns sleep on and off through the day and night. 😴 Total sleeping time varies between babies – and can last up to 18 hours a day. That may sound like a lot, but babies tend to sleep only in short stretches. They need to be fed and changed regularly between sleeps.

This can be tiring for a new mom, so try to take naps when your baby is sleeping. As baby gets older, you will see she has longer periods of wakefulness during the day, and longer sleeping times during the night.

Parents often wonder when their baby will start sleeping through the night 🌌. This varies a lot. Your baby might sleep through after a few months – or it could take 2 years. Both are completely normal.

*Safe sleeping space*
The safest place for your baby to sleep is on her back in her own bed 🛏️ in your room. Don't put any pillows or big fluffy blankets in baby's bed – these could suffocate her. ","['sleep', 'refuse', 'hours', 'night', 'day']","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]",1,,

Breast milk is produced on a demand and supply base. 🤱🏽 This means that the more often your baby drinks from your breast, the more your breast produces milk. After your baby is born, it's important to feed him whenever he wants. This is called 'feeding on demand' and helps to establish your breast milk production.

The first milk you produce is a yellow, sticky milk called colostrum. This sticky milk is full of antibodies – and very healthy for your baby. Around day 4 after baby's birth 👶🏽, you will notice that your breasts start to fill up, feeling hard and heavy. You are now producing breast milk.

Feed your baby whenever he wants. It's normal for a baby to want 8 or more feeds within a single day. When you're breastfeeding, it's important to eat healthily 🥗 and drink lots of water🚰.

The most effective way to produce enough breast milk for your baby, is to feed frequently. You may also increase your milk production by eating foods like: oats, pawpaw, carrots 🥕, garlic, green leafy vegetables 🥬, chickpeas, dates, nuts, and brown rice.

Your breasts will produce milk as long as baby demands it. But sometimes, breasts need care of their own.

*Cracked nipples*
This is caused by incorrect latching (how baby grips the breast to feed). A good latch promotes milk flow and limits nipple pain for the mom. A poor latch means baby doesn't get enough milk – and can quickly lead to sore and cracked nipples. 😕

Baby should have his mouth around most of the dark area of your nipple. If you see his jaw moving up and down as he feeds, you know he has latched well.

Use nipple cream 🧴 for cracked nipples. If you are HIV positive, don't feed baby on the affected breast.

*Breast engorgement*
Breast engorgement is when your breasts are too full, feeling hard, tight and painful. This happens if baby hasn't fed for a while. Let him feed – or express milk to relieve the pressure and prevent mastitis, a painful breast infection 🦠 that needs medical care.

*Blocked milk ducts*
If a milk-making gland in your breast isn't emptied during a feed 🤱🏽, it can lead to a blocked duct. You may feel a small, tender lump in your breast. During feeding, place your baby with her chin pointing towards the lump so he can feed from that part of the breast. Apply a warm compress on your breast for the pain. Avoid wearing tight clothes or bras.

*Thrush*
If you have pain in both breasts and it lasts for up to an hour after a feed, you may have developed thrush. Thrush is a fungal infection that affects you and your baby. If you have thrush please go to the clinic to get treatment for both you and baby.

Your baby's age determines how often your baby needs to be breast-fed. 🤱🏽 In the first few weeks, she should feed on demand every 2 to 3 hours. If she sleeps longer than 4 hours, wake her up to feed.

Feed at least 8 to 12 times in any 24-hour period.

As your baby grows, this will change:
- By 2 months, she will feed every 3 to 4 hours.
- By 6 months, most babies will feed every 4 to 5 hours.
- After 6 months, introduce solid foods but continue to breastfeed after every meal until baby is 12 months old.

When you're away from her, leave expressed breast milk 🍼 for your partner or caregiver to give her using a cup. Try to avoid using bottles or dummies. These may interfere with breastfeeding and are difficult to clean properly, carrying germs 🦠 that can make your baby sick.

Latching is the way your baby grips the breast with his mouth.🤱🏽 It's important he latches correctly for successful breastfeeding. A good latch means baby gets enough milk out – without giving you sore or cracked nipples.

To latch your baby:
- make sure he is facing you,
- his head should be slightly tilted backwards and not turned to the side
- his mouth should be open wide
- you bring his head towards the breast.

When latched, his lips should be curled outwards, with a good mouthful of your breast. Check that he has most of the dark area around your nipple in his mouth.
If you see his jaw moving up and down as he feeds, you know he has latched on well.

*Expressing (handling) breast milk*
Express breast milk by squeezing or pumping your breast milk into a container (see video at the end of this message).🍼 Before handling breast milk, wash your hands with soap 🧼 and water.

*Storing breast milk*
Store the expressed milk in a clean container made of glass (like a jar) or hard plastic (but no plastic made with the chemical BPA or bisphenol A.) Before use, sterilise the container by boiling it for 10 minutes. Before storing, use a pen to write the date you expressed the milk on the container.

Store the expressed breast milk in the sterilised container for:
- 4 days at the back of your fridge, or
- 6 to 12 months at the back of your freezer

*Defrosting or reheating stored breast milk*
Once you have started expressing, it's important you know how to safely store the milk. Always defrost the oldest breast milk first. There are several ways to defrost your breast milk:
- In the fridge overnight ❄️,
- Set in a container of warm or lukewarm water🚰,
- Under luke warm running water 🚿.

Never defrost or heat breast milk in a microwave. A microwave can destroy the nutrients in your breastmilk and create hot spots, which can burn baby’s mouth. Breast milk that is warmed after storage in the fridge or freezer, should be used within 2 hours. Never refreeze breastmilk.

Weaning is when you introduce food to your baby that is not your own breast milk. It's recommended that you exclusively breastfeed your baby for the first 6 months, then continue breastfeeding while introducing solid foods 🥣 until he is 2 years old.

Babies react differently to weaning. If weaning is your decision, it’s best to do so gradually. If you wean suddenly (“cold turkey”), your breasts will become painfully engorged, and you may develop a breast infection 🦠. Baby might not like the switch from the breast to the bottle. Please don't wean your baby while he is sick.

*Weaning a baby under 1 year*
First replace his least favourite feeding of the day with formula. If he won’t accept the bottle 🍼 from you, see if he accepts someone else giving it. Let him adjust over a few days, each time replacing a breastfeed with a bottle.

*Weaning an older child*
There's no reason to stop breastfeeding after the first year. Both you and baby continue to benefit from breastfeeding. Many mothers choose to wean naturally, allowing the child to wean in his own time. Natural weaning happens between 2 to 4 years. If you decide to wean, set boundaries with your toddler 🧒🏽 – for example, start by limiting feeding during the day.

*Weaning when HIV-positive*
- If you're HIV+ and decide to stop breastfeeding, please do so gradually over a period of a month.
- To abruptly stop breastfeeding is not recommended, and may increase the Viral Load in breast milk.
- If you breastfeed occasionally after starting to wean, your baby is at risk of becoming HIV infected.

Ask a nurse to help you with your choice of product. It's important to know that formula milk does not contain all the nutrients and antibodies found in breast milk.

*Recommended schedule for formula feeding*
- First week: Slowly increase the amount you offer to your baby. Start with 10 ml on day 1 and increase every day.  At the end of the first week your baby will drink 60–90 ml of formula per feed, every 3 to 4 hours. If your baby sleeps longer than 4 to 5 hours and starts missing feeds, wake her up and offer a bottle. 🍼
- First month: Baby will drink about 120 ml per feeding every 4 hours after one month.
- At 6 months: Baby will drink 180–240 ml 4 to 5 times a day.
- After 6 months, introduce solid foods, but continue to bottle feed after every meal until baby is 12 months.

- Wash your hands 🧼 before preparing a bottle,
- Use a clean bottle for every feed,

Latent HIV is also called asymptomatic HIV infection – because there are no symptoms. Latency in HIV infection can last for 10 or 15 years. Most people don't have symptoms that they can see or feel.

It's important to tell the nurse/midwife 👩🏽‍⚕️ about your HIV status, and to ask that you are given your baby Nevirapine syrup after birth. Make sure your baby continues to take Nevirapine for 6 weeks.

If you're HIV-positive, then breastfeeding is the best way to feed your baby.🤱🏽 The ARVs you're taking and the medication (Nevirapine) baby was given at the clinic, will reduce baby's risk of getting HIV through your breast milk.

Exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of baby's life is recommended. This means you only feed your baby breast milk – no water 🚱or formula should be given. After 6 months, please continue to feed baby breast milk while introducing solid foods.

*Weaning from breastfeeding*
If you decide to stop breastfeeding, you should do so gradually over a period of one month. 🗓️ An abrupt stop to breastfeeding is not recommended and may increase the viral load (VL) in breast milk. If you breastfeed occasionally after starting to wean, your baby is at risk of becoming HIV infected. Make sure you continue to take your ARVs 💊.","['ways', 'feed', 'wean']","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]",1,,

Remember that HIV spreads through bodily fluids, like blood and vaginal fluids. This is why it is possible for the virus to spread to a baby from the mother during pregnancy, labour, delivery and breastfeeding. PMTCT treatment helps prevent this.

It is highly unlikely that baby could get HIV from the sperm of an HIV+ father. This is even less likely if the father is on treatment and has a suppressed viral load.

HIV is not spread through sweat, spit or urine. So it can't be spread through coughing, sneezing, hugging, kissing, or sharing cups and plates with someone who has the virus. So it is very unlikely that a baby will get HIV from a caregiver.

Anyone who has tested positive for HIV should discuss ARV treatment with their healthcare provider. This can help them live a long and healthy life, and can help prevent the spread of the virus.","['father', 'hiv', 'spread']","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]",1,,

The first bath will be a sponge bath. Pick a warm room with a flat surface, like a bathroom or kitchen counter, a changing table, or a bed. Cover the surface with a thick towel. Make sure the room is warm, as babies chill easily.

*Get all the things you need*
Before the bath, make sure you have:

• Bath sponge or clean wash cloth (double-rinsed) 🧽
• Clean blanket or bath towel (a hooded one helps keep baby's head warm)
• Clean nappy 🐣
• Clean clothes 🧥
• Warm water (not hot!) 💦

*Be careful*
🔥 Make sure you test the water temperature with your elbow. The water should be the same as your body temperature.

❗️ Never leave babies alone in the bath, not even for a second. They can drown quickly in very shallow water!

📱 Turn your phone off while bathing your baby. You’ll be less likely to get distracted.

🚼 Dry and dress your baby on a towel on the floor if possible. It’s safer than on a changing table. If you’re using a changing table, always keep one hand on your baby.","['bath', 'newborn']","[0.3, 0.3]",1,,

The best way to protect your child from dangerous diseases is to get them vaccinated.

Diseases like measles, polio and TB can be deadly and can damage children’s health for life.

*Measles*
Measles is a dangerous disease that spreads very quickly. In the past, many children died from measles. Children can also be left with permanent damage to their health.

Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of measles. Babies should get the measles vaccine at 6 and 12 months.

*Polio*
Polio used to kill and paralyse many children all over the world. The polio vaccine is one of biggest immunisation success stories. It has ended widespread polio epidemics and many countries have no more cases of polio.

To completely get rid of polio in SA, we need to make sure that all children are vaccinated. Baby will get the vaccine drops in her mouth at birth and at 6 weeks. Then she’ll get an injection at 6, 10 and 14 weeks, and again at 18 months.

*TB*
TB is one of the deadliest diseases in SA. All children in SA get the BCG vaccine at birth. This helps baby’s immune system build antibodies to protect against some serious forms of TB (like TB in the brain membrane) but it does not prevent TB in baby’s lungs. If baby has been around someone who has TB, she will need to take a six-month course of medicine to stay protected.","['vaccine', 'diseases', 'baby', 'clinic', 'injection']","[0.3, 0.3]",1,,

Children get vaccinated at:

• 6 weeks
• 10 weeks
• 14 weeks
• 6 months
• 9 months
• 12 months
• 18 months
• 6 years
• 9 years
• 12 years

Most vaccines are injections, but a few are given as drops in baby’s mouth.

*Side effects*
Sometimes vaccines can make baby’s arm or leg sore at the injection site. Or baby may feel a little sick with a fever. These side effects are usually mild. If you are worried, speak to the nurse about what to do.

*Does it hurt?*
If you are worried that the vaccination will be painful, remember that serious illness is much worse than the short pain from an injection! The nurse will explain how to hold baby to make it as easy and painless as possible. Try distracting baby with a small toy and comfort baby afterwards with a feed.

If the clinic is out of stock of the vaccine baby needs, please go to another health facility. You can phone first to check if they have stock available.

If you miss baby’s clinic visit for any reason, don’t stay away! Please go to the clinic as soon as you can.","['baby', 'vaccine']","[0.3, 0.3]",1,,

Vaccines save at least three million lives every year, from deadly diseases like Measles, Polio and Tetanus.

In SA, children get vaccinated against at least 10 dangerous diseases. Most vaccines are given by injection, but some are given as drops in the mouth.

These vaccines have been very carefully tested to make sure that they are safe and have been safely given to millions of children.

Baby will get her first vaccines at birth against TB and Polio. She should get the next set of vaccines at the clinic at 6 weeks.

Vaccines at the government clinic are free for under 12s.

The Road to Health booklet lists all the vaccines baby needs. Remember to check the booklet for the next date and bring the booklet to each clinic visit.

Children’s bodies and brains develop the most in the first 1000 days of their lives and you can boost this development.

*Milestones*
Baby is learning new things every day. We expect babies to be able to do certain things at around the same age. We call these developmental milestones. For example, most babies can sit on their own by 9 months.

Each child develops in their own time. The developmental milestones are guidelines -  some babies will master skills sooner than others, and others may be slower. If baby doesn’t reach the milestones in the usual time, it is important to investigate.

*Supporting baby’s development*
Although baby doesn’t have much control of her body yet, she can already see, hear, smell, taste, feel and sense movement.

To support baby’s development:
- Talk to her
- Massage her body
- Show her different colours and patterns
- Let her hold and touch different things
- Cuddle and love her

And remember that exclusive breastfeeding gives baby the best nutrition for her growing body and brain. It also helps build a strong bond between mom and baby which is also important for development.","['sit', 'talk', 'walk', 'months']","[0.3, 0.3, 0.3]",1,,

Being HIV-positive doesn't automatically mean your baby will be HIV-infected. As long as you start/continue to take your ARVs 💊, the chances of transmission are less than 2%.

*Newly HIV-positive*
During your pregnancy clinic visits 🤰🏽, you will be tested for HIV. Please agree to these tests.
