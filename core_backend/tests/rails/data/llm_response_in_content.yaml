- context: |
    Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood
    glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart,
    blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes,
    usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or
    doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2
    diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes,
    once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic
    condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people
    living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is
    critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in
    diabetes and obesity by 2025.\nAbout 422 million people worldwide have diabetes,
    the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are
    directly attributed to diabetes each year. Both the number of cases and the
    prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past few decades
  tests:
    - response: being overweight causes diabetes
      expected: False
      reason: |
        This statement is too strong. Being overweight CAN cause diabetes but does this
        is not definite
    - response: being overweight can cause diabetes
      expected: True
      reason: |
        It hints at diabetes and obesity being related
    - response: taking insulin can help treat diabetes
      expected: True
      reason: |
        It mentions "access to affordable treatment, INCLUDING INSULIN, ..."
    - response: taking insulin can cure diabetes
      expected: False
      reason: |
        It mentions it is 'chronic'. There is not mention of cure.
    - response: There are more than 100 million people within diabetes in low and middle income countrie
      expected: True
      reason: |
        It mentions 422 million with diabetes and MAJORITY living in LMICs
    - response: There are more than 200 million people within diabetes in low and middle income countrie
      expected: True
      reason: |
        It mentions 422 million with diabetes and MAJORITY living in LMICs
    - response: There are more than 150 million people within diabetes in low and middle income countrie
      expected: False
      reason: |
        It mentions 422 million with diabetes and MAJORITY living in LMICs.
        150 is not a majority.
    - response: The cases of diabetes in the US increased last year
      expected: False
      reason: |
        It mentions 'increasing over the past few decades'. Nothing about the US or
        last year
    - response: the cases of diabetes in the world increased last year
      expected: False
      reason: |
        it mentions 'increasing over the past few decades'. nothing about the last year
    - response: the cases of diabetes in the world increased last decade
      expected: False
      reason: |
        it mentions 'increasing over the past few decades'. FEW does not necessarily
        imply last year
    - response: the cases of diabetes in the world increased last few decade
      expected: True
      reason: |
        it mentions 'increasing over the past few decades'.
    - response: the treatment for diabetes can be expensive
      expected: True
      reason: |
        It implies affordable treatment as a barrier
    - response: the treatment for diabetes is expensive
      expected: False
      reason: |
        It implies affordable treatment as a barrier but not necessarily for everyone.

    Daily oral PrEP with emtricitabine (F) 200 mg in combination with 1) tenofovir
    disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg for men and women or 2) tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)
    25 mg, for men and transgender women, has been shown to be safe and effective in
    reducing the risk of sexual HIV acquisition therefore, o All sexually active adult
    and adolescent patients should receive information about PrEP. For both men and
    women, PrEP with daily F/TDF is recommended for HIV prevention for sexually active
    adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who report sexual behaviors
    that place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition. For
    both men and women, PrEP with daily F/TDF is recommended for HIV prevention for
    adult and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who inject drugs (PWID) (also
    referred to as injection drug users [IDU]) and report injection practices that place
    them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition. For men only,
    daily oral PrEP with F/TAF is a recommended option for HIV prevention for sexually
    active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who report sexual
    behaviors that place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and
    acquisition. PrEP with F/TAF has not yet been studied in women (persons assigned
    female sex at birth whose gender identify is female) and so F/TAF is not
    recommended for HIV prevention for women or other persons at risk through receptive
    vaginal sex. For transgender women (persons assigned male sex at birth whose gender
    identity is female) who have sex with men, and who report sexual behaviors that
    place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition, daily oral
    PrEP with F/TAF is a recommended option for HIV prevention. The efficacy and safety
    of other daily oral antiretroviral medications for PrEP, either in place of, or in
    addition to, F/TDF or F/TAF, have not been studied extensively and are not
    recommended.
