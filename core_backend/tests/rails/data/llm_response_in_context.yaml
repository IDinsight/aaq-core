- context: |
    Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood
    glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart,
    blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes,
    usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or
    doesn't make enough insulin. In the past 3 decades the prevalence of type 2
    diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes,
    once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic
    condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people
    living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is
    critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in
    diabetes and obesity by 2025.\nAbout 422 million people worldwide have diabetes,
    the majority living in low-and middle-income countries, and 1.5 million deaths are
    directly attributed to diabetes each year. Both the number of cases and the
    prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing over the past few decades
  tests:
    - statement: being overweight causes diabetes

    Daily oral PrEP with emtricitabine (F) 200 mg in combination with 1) tenofovir
    disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg for men and women or 2) tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)
    25 mg, for men and transgender women, has been shown to be safe and effective in
    reducing the risk of sexual HIV acquisition therefore, o All sexually active adult
    and adolescent patients should receive information about PrEP. For both men and
    women, PrEP with daily F/TDF is recommended for HIV prevention for sexually active
    adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who report sexual behaviors
    that place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition. For
    both men and women, PrEP with daily F/TDF is recommended for HIV prevention for
    adult and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who inject drugs (PWID) (also
    referred to as injection drug users [IDU]) and report injection practices that place
    them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition. For men only,
    daily oral PrEP with F/TAF is a recommended option for HIV prevention for sexually
    active adults and adolescents weighing at least 35 kg (77 lb) who report sexual
    behaviors that place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and
    acquisition. PrEP with F/TAF has not yet been studied in women (persons assigned
    female sex at birth whose gender identify is female) and so F/TAF is not
    recommended for HIV prevention for women or other persons at risk through receptive
    vaginal sex. For transgender women (persons assigned male sex at birth whose gender
    identity is female) who have sex with men, and who report sexual behaviors that
    place them at substantial ongoing risk of HIV exposure and acquisition, daily oral
    PrEP with F/TAF is a recommended option for HIV prevention. The efficacy and safety
    of other daily oral antiretroviral medications for PrEP, either in place of, or in
    addition to, F/TDF or F/TAF, have not been studied extensively and are not
    recommended.

    When used appropriately with adequate quality water, antimicrobial chemicals help
    minimize the potential for microbial contamination of processing water and
    subsequent cross contamination of the product. The effectiveness of an
    antimicrobial agent, as well as the amount that should be used, depends on the
    treatment conditions, such as water temperature, acidity [pH], water hardness,
    contact time, amount and rate of product throughput, type of product, water to
    product ratio, amount of organic material, and the resistance of pathogens to the
    particular antimicrobial agent. For example, the antimicrobial activity of a
    chlorine-based disinfectant depends on the amount of hypochlorous acid (also
    called "free chlorine") present in the water. The amount of hypochlorous acid in
    the water depends upon the pH of the water, the amount of organic material in the
    water, and, to some extent, the temperature of the water. If the amount of
    hypochlorous acid is not maintained when the amount of organic material increases,
    the antimicrobial agent may lose effectiveness in maintaining water quality. If a
    fresh-cut processor uses a chlorine containing compound as a disinfectant, we
    recommend that the processor monitor the processing water for free chlorine or
    hypochlorous acid concentrations. As another example, the measurement of
    Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) is used as an indicator of the activity of any
    antimicrobial agent that is an oxidizer and as a measure of the agent's
    effectiveness during processing.

        chlorine or hypochlorous acid concentrations.
    - statement: |
        Your fresh-cut processor should monitor for water temperature and water hardness
      expected: False
      reason: |
        It does not say that these should be monitored. Just free-chlorine
    - statement: your fresh-cut processor must monitor for ORP
      expected: False
      reason: |
        It is given as an example of something your processor COULD monitor. It is not
        necessary
    - statement: higher hypochlorous acid means less effective animicrobial agent
      expected: False
      reason: |
        It is not clear from the context. If anything, it is implied that higher acid
        means MORE effective antimicorbial agent

    Full blood count testing is the recommended method for diagnosing
    anaemia during pregnancy. In settings where full blood count testing is not
    available, onsite haemoglobin testing with a haemoglobinometer is recommended over
    the use of the haemoglobin colour scale as the method for diagnosing anaemia in
    pregnancy. Midstream urine culture is the recommended method for diagnosing
    asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in pregnancy. In settings where urine culture is not
    available, on-site midstream urine Gram-staining is recommended over the use of
    dipstick tests as the method for diagnosing ASB in pregnancy. Clinical enquiry about
    the possibility of intimate partner violence (IPV) should be strongly considered at
    antenatal care visits when assessing conditions that may be caused or complicated by
    IPV in order to improve clinical diagnosis and subsequent care, where there is the
    capacity to provide a supportive response (including referral where appropriate) and
    where the WHO minimum requirements are met. Hyperglycaemia first detected at any time
    during pregnancy should be classified as either gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
    or diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, according to WHO criteria. Health-care providers
    should ask all pregnant women about their tobacco use (past and present) and exposure
    to second-hand smoke as early as possible in pregnancy and at every antenatal care
    visit. Health-care providers should ask all pregnant women about their
    use of alcohol and other substances (past and present) as early as possible in the
    pregnancy and at every antenatal care visit.
