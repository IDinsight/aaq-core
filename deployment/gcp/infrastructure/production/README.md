0. Set up terraform backend as per `tf_backend/README.md`
1. Update `production.auto.tfvars` file
2. Initialize with `terraform init -backend-config=backend.conf`
3. `terraform apply`

   You may be prompted to enter your GCP project_id and service_account_email.

   sure to enter the correct values.
5. Before CI/CD scripts can run, make sure to

   1. Save Github Secrets
   2. Register an SSH key for your compute instance

      ```shell
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/aaq-key
      gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add --key-file ~/.ssh/aaq-key.pub --project <GCP PROJECT ID>
      ```

   3. Link the static IP that's been created for the VM to your domain.
