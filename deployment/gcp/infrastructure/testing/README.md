# Instructions for testing deployment

0. Set up terraform backend as per `tf_backend/README.md`
1. Update `testing.auto.tfvars` file
2. Initialize with `terraform init -backend-config=backend.conf`
3. `terraform apply`

   You will be prompted to enter your GCP project_id and service_account_email.

   Alternatively, you can export the following environment variables so that these
   variables are applied for each `terraform` command:

   ```shell
   export TF_VAR_gcp_project_id=<PROJECT_ID>
   export TF_VAR_service_account_email=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>
   ```

4. Go to GCP Secret Manager. For all secrets with `autogenerated: False` label, make
   sure to enter the correct values.
5. Before CI/CD scripts can run, make sure to

   1. Save Github Secrets
   2. Register an SSH key for your compute instance

      ```shell
      ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/aaq-key
      gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add --key-file ~/.ssh/aaq-key.pub --project <GCP PROJECT ID>
      ```

   3. Link the static IP that's been created for the VM to your domain.
